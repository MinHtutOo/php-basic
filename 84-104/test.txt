I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, In the East of England, and was given my poot father’s name, David Copperfield. Sadly, he never saw me. He was much older than my mother when they married, and died six months before I was born. My father’s death made my beautiful young mother very unhappy, and she knew she would find life extremely difficult with a new baby and no husband.
